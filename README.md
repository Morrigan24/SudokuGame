# SudokuGame
Sudoku game with IU that I made as my final project for my Java class in College

  Since many people don't know how to play a sudoku game my focus was to help people, at least the ones on the class,
understand how to play it. I added a limited feature called "Check" which would literaly check if everything was 
alright or if there is an error, there is a limited amount of checks so this feature would not be exploted. I also 
have a "reset" and "X" button which I would use as erasers, one clearing up individual boxes while the other clears
all the inputed values.
  To play numbers you have to select them in the bottom where the numbers 1-9 are, then you can click in one of the 
empty spaces to change the value to the picked number.
  The "Get the W" button was just for test but I just realized I included it in this build of the game. It won't hurt 
to have either way.


--Known bugs--
-there is a problem with the validating part for the smaller 3x3 where most of the time it doesn't work and it also 
has a bug where sometimes the same number is placed in different 3x3 matrices but the are next to each other diagonally
and it marks it wrong.
-if no number is picked and the boxes are clicked upon it would assign the last value picked.
